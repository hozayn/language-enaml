# language-enaml package

Enaml language support in Atom.

_It's just [original sublime text tmLanguage file](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml/blob/master/tools/sublimetext/Enaml.tmLanguage) by Chris Colbert converted to Atom package._


_Release versions mismatch: '$ apm publish minor' creates new version tag automatically and i was unaware of it. So, current release is 0.3.0 mistakenly tagged as 0.4.0. Mismatch will be fixed with next version.
